1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

As websites become increasingly complex with more data being processed; React handles that data in a virtual DOM to prevent the browser from slowing down, by serving that data as needed. This creates a better end user experience.  

2. What does it mean to think in react?

It means visualizing the project/code in reusable components, rather than the whole.

3. Describe state.

State is data that is local to a component. 

4. Describe props.

Props are the data is passed down from a component to where they are needed.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects affect stuff outside of the scope of a function that is being called.
